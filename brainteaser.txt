Let’s say that you have 25 horses, and you want to pick the fastest 3 horses out of those 25. 
In each race, only 5 horses can run at the same time because there are only 5 tracks. 
What is the minimum number of races required to find the 3 fastest horses without using a stopwatch?
5*5=> 5*3 left, then let the 1st runner of 5 group to compete in the 6th round, eliminate 4th, 5th group, and 2nd/3rd in third group, 
the leader of the 1st group, left 5 horses for the final, => total=7

You have a birthday cake and have exactly 3 cuts to cut it into 8 equal pieces. How do you do it?

one horizontally down the center of the cake and the other vertically down the center of the cake.  
Then stack them and cut it from center

Suppose that you are standing in a hallway next to 3 light switches, which are all off. 
There is another room down the hallway, where there are 3 incandescent light bulbs – 
each light bulb is operated by one of the switches in the hallway. Because the light 
bulbs are in another room, you can not see them since you are standing in the hallway. 
How would you figure out which switch operates which light bulb, if you can only go 
the room with the light bulbs one time, and only one time?
Warm one bulb before entering room
