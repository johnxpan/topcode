Let’s say that you have 25 horses, and you want to pick the fastest 3 horses out of those 25. 
In each race, only 5 horses can run at the same time because there are only 5 tracks. 
What is the minimum number of races required to find the 3 fastest horses without using a stopwatch?
5*5=> 5*3 left, then let the 1st runner of 5 group to compete in the 6th round, eliminate 4th, 5th group, and 2nd/3rd in third group, 
the leader of the 1st group, left 5 horses for the final, => total=7

You have a birthday cake and have exactly 3 cuts to cut it into 8 equal pieces. How do you do it?
The answer: stack the pieces

The “correct” answer is to cut the cake in quarters (4 pieces) using 2 of the cuts – 
one horizontally down the center of the cake and the other vertically down the center of the cake.  
Then stack them and cut it from center

Suppose that you are standing in a hallway next to 3 light switches, which are all off. 
There is another room down the hallway, where there are 3 incandescent light bulbs – 
each light bulb is operated by one of the switches in the hallway. Because the light 
bulbs are in another room, you can not see them since you are standing in the hallway. 
How would you figure out which switch operates which light bulb, if you can only go 
the room with the light bulbs one time, and only one time?
Warm one bulb before entering room

You are given 8 pennies, 7 of which weigh exactly the same, but one penny weighs less than the other 7. 
You also have a judge scale. Find the one penny that weighs the least in less than 3 steps.

First, you split the 8 pennies into 3 groups of pennies – 2 groups with 3 pennies each and 1 group with 2 pennies. 
         Then, you compare the weight of the first two groups of 3 pennies each by putting them on the scale.
Scenario #1: The 2 groups weigh the same. This means the lightest coin is in the group of 2. 
  So, take those 2 pennies and compare them to each other and find the lightest coin.

Scenario #2: The 1st group weighs more than the 2nd group. Take group #2 (3 pennies) and 
pick any 2 pennies out of that group of 3. If they weight the same, then the third penny is lighter. 
If they don’t weigh the same then the lighter one is obviously the lightest penny.

There’s an activity in America, with one-on-one contests, and a national championship. 
The same person won the championship on two different occasions about 65 years apart. 
Name the activity.

This was a question that Charlie Munger (a partner of Warren Buffet’s) asked a group of students in a speech he gave. 
This is a fun question to try to answer, because it really is just a test to see your analytical skills. 
Try to figure this out on your own – we’re sure that you can figure out the answer on your own if you think carefully.

Breaking the problem down
Let’s figure this out. Well, since the championship was won by the same person over a span of 65 years, that means the
second time around this person must have won the championship when he was at least 85 years old, 
and that’s assuming that he first won the championship when he was at least 20 years old.

This also means that there’s no way that this activity requires any hand eye coordination – 
because anyone over 85 years old will simply not be able to beat someone in his 20’s. 
So, there’s no way this was a billiards tournament, and definitely not a tennis tournament.

What about a chess tournament? Well, even though it is a mental game, it does require quite a bit of stamina
– and is far too competitive for an 85 year old to be competitive at a national level, 
even if he can beat a lot of other younger people. If not chess, then what about checkers? 
Well, that sounds like a potential answer! Because, that is definitely a game where experience
can make you the best even though you may be 85 years old. And it’s also a game which does 
not require much stamina, or any athleticism at all. And that is the correct answer – it is a checker’s tournament.

The name of this person, in case you were wondering is Asa A. Long (born on 20 Aug 1904). 
He became the youngest US national champion, at 18 years old 64 days, when he won in Boston, Massachusetts, 
USA on 23 Oct 1922. He then became the oldest person to win the national checkers tournament in America, 
at age 79 years 334 days when he won his sixth title in Tupelo, Mississippi, USA on 21 Jul 1984.

=====================
Four people need to cross a rickety rope bridge to get back to their camp at night. Unfortunately, 
they only have one flashlight and it only has enough light left for seventeen minutes. 
The bridge is too dangerous to cross without a flashlight, 
and it’s only strong enough to support two people at any given time.

Each of the campers walks at a different speed. One can cross the bridge in 1 minute, another in 2 minutes,
the third in 5 minutes, and the slowest camper takes 10 minutes to cross. 
How can the campers make it across in exactly 17 minutes?
The guy who return the the light must be faster (1m or 2m guy, use only 1m guy is not good, because it require 1m to back forward many times)
5m/10m guy must go together to save time
